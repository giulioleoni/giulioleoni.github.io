    description: "Gunpyre is a project developed by 13 students from different courses of my academy, and it's a twin stick shooter with rougue-like elements. I joined the team on october 2023 and I started working as a gameplay programmer. The game was developed using Unreal 5.1 and was scripted entirely with blueprints. The project received excellent feedback from professors and the academy even decided to publish it on Steam. You can go to the Steam page by clicking this text box.",
    date: "the most challenging aspect was undoubtedly implementing enemy behaviour and matching it with the design requirements, but it was also fun ",

    name: "Warm-up Game Jam",
    description: "This project was made for the Warm up Game Jam organised by my academy on 23-27 September 2024. It's an entirely UI game in which you have to create potions following different recipes. We were a team of five students, we developed this project using Unreal 5.3 and it was scripted entirely with blueprints. It was interesting to work on a game project purely UI, it allowed me to understand and learn more about the functionalities of the UI of Unreal and experience new things I didn't know. All this combined with the context of the jam, which is always stimulating. You can find more by clicking this text box.",

    description: "I developed this project together with four other students from the programming course. We developed this project at the end of the second year of our course in A.I.V. and we worked on it 5 weeks starting in June 2023. It's a very arcade Third Person Shooter made with Unity in which you must fight off several waves of zombies in order to win. The purpose was to combine all the Unity knowledge acquired during the course into a single project, creating something more organic and structured, following a well-defined development process. We worked doing weekly sprints, at the end of the week there was a review by our professors who also checked the division of tasks (we used Trello to help us)",

    name: "Journey to The roots",
    description: "This was the first group project and the first jam I participated in. On occasion of the Global Game Jam 2023, I joined a group of students from my academy and we developed a platformer, the particularity of which is that the character can only jump, so you have to calibrate the strength of the jump well. We developed this project using Unreal 4.27 and it was scripted entirely with blueprints. It was an extremely exciting experience, I had never participated in anything like that, and it was also very stimulating, at the time I knew very little about unreal and this experience forced me to learn many things and find ingenious solutions to problems. This allowed me to grow a lot, I started learning how to communicate with others, I started to understand how long it takes me to complete certain tasks and also how to be more autonomous in my work.",
